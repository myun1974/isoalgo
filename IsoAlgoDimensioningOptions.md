# IsoAlgo Dimensioning Options #

## 1.Introduction ##
IsoAlgo can output several types of dimensions with different amounts of detail. The main types of dimensioning are:
  * String dimensions(the default);
  * Composite dimensions;
  * Overall dimensions;
  * Support Dimensions;

The different types are illustrated in the following figure: <br>

<h2>2.Details</h2>
<b>String dimensions</b> are measured between the following points:<br>
<ul><li>The start or end of a branch;<br>
</li><li>Changes of direction(bends, elbows etc.);<br>
</li><li>Component connection points(flanges, welds, screwed and compression joints etc., excluding gaskets);</li></ul>

<b>Composite dimensioning</b> ignores dimensions which the fabricator has no control over, particularly the sizes of individual components. Component which are directly connected to each other are therefore dimensioned as though they constitute a single composite item.<br>
<br>
<b>Overall dimensions</b> indicate the lengths of the following sections of a pipeline:<br>
<ul><li>From the start of a branch to the first change of direction;<br>
</li><li>From each change diretion to the next;<br>
</li><li>From the last change of direction to the end of a Branch;<br>
</li><li>From the start of a falling section skew-box to the end of the falling section skew-box;<br>
</li><li>Between Branch connections.</li></ul>

In IsoAlgo you can config the dimensioning options by IsoAlgoConfig.xml. By choosing different representation for different dimension type: <br>
